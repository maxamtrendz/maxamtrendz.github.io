All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.

And all the activity merely data points;<br>
They have their highs and their lows,<br>
And one girl in her time analyzes many points,<br>
Her analyses preserved below for the ages....<br>
